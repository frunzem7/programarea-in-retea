# HangMan

**A simple country name guessing game!**

### Introduction

In our university, There was a course called **"Advanced Object Oriented Programming"**. In this course, we had to build a basic word guessing game based on Java language. Then I made this "HangMan" game using the JavaFx framework and using scenebuilder for the GUI. In this game, some autogenerated country name has been shown with the symbol "X" and "_". Here, "X" represents Vowel and "__" represents Consonant. User's task is to guess the country name by submiting single letters. User have only 6 chances to win the match.
